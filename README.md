Hi everybody, welcome to my puppet modules.

This has the aim of installing modules more for fun than for actual servers
(Dropbox, Hamachi, ...).

Only a few of these are 'production', the other are just tests.
Please bear with me for a few more months ok?

TODO
====

* Integrate / Investigate: puppet-module . i.e.:
	puppet-module search iptables
* MyGicRepo


* Integrate with this intriguing page:
	http://projects.reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Cron_Patterns

Interesting:
